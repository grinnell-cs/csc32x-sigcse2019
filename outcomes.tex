\section{Outcomes}

Soft skills.

An understanding of the value of what you do.

We hope: Sense of self efficacy: "Hey, I can throw together a decent
database-backed Web site in a week, at least if everything goes right."

We hope: Broader "learning how to learn".  Regularly face situations
in which they can't just find an answer in a textbook.  Also many
situations in which they can't just find the answer on StackOverflow.
So a lot of practice in finding the right way to do a Web search,
how to trace issues through a program, interpret waht they find online,
and more.

Tolerance of ambiguity.  Used to clearly specified assignments.  These
are open-ended.

Unfortunately, we have not seen as many positive effects of
end-of-course evaluations as we had hoped.  While some students
consider the course the center of their education, others seem to
find it pointless.  As one student puts it, ``In this course, more
than most, what you get out of this course depends directly on what
you put into the course.''
