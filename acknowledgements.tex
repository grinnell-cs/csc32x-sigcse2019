We appreciate the support of our community partners in this endeavor.
They've been helpful, cooperative, and understanding.  Our alumni mentors
have also made for much better projects; their willingness to support
our students with no compensation is a testimony to their
commitment to our institution, the department, and the discipline.  
Our partners in Careers, Life, and Service have been essential to
the class; we particularly appreciate their permission to share
simulated versions of their Q\&A session with the students.
